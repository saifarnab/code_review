The payload cannot overlap the ramstage or stack, but it is perfectly fine for the kernel to reclaim those areas once they're loaded (unlike actual reserved memory resources like the BL31 on ARM).

If we want to handle both of these cases in bootmem, we'd need to invent a new memory type for the latter and then somehow translate it back into the RAM type at the right time (probably in bootmem_write_memory_table()). (I guess LB_MEM_ACPI is technically already something very similar to this, but it doesn't look like Linux ever actually reclaims that area the way the spec allows it to if I understand it right.)

I can see that some of the existing code already violates this distinction and just gets away with by virtue of only reserving the range after coreboot tables have been written. I guess your stuff will end up getting saved by the same loophole. I don't think that's a great design, though, it's not at all obvious what happens there. I think it would be much better to handle this explicitly with a magic memory type, and to add a check to bootmem_add_range() to ensure that no ranges that don't use this magic type get added after bootmem_write_memory_tables() has run. We want frameworks that fail obviously when someone writes code that won't have the expected effect, not those that explicitly rely on weird ordering interactions like that."

int pci_ehci_debug_dev(int hdc_idx, int *dev, int *func);

Then there is no need for the simple_device_t, right?"
